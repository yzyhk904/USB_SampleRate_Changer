## Change logs

* Fixed for Pixel 8's

# v2.8.1
* Tuned "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" for reducing I/O scheduling jitter on Tensor devices
* Fixed a bug for "--force-bluetooth-qti" option
* Tuned "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" for reducing CFQ I/O scheduling jitter on Qcomm devices

# v2.8.0
* Tuned "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" for reducing I/O scheduling jitter on most devices
* Added "Usage_Samples" to easily execute every script with its typical parameters on file explorers with some sh script execution capability like "mixplorer"

# v2.7.3
* Fixed "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" to change "performance" governor of GPU without fail
* Tuned "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" for reducing I/O scheduling jitter on Tensor devices

# v2.7.2
* Tuned "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" for reducing I/O scheduling jitter, especially for Tensor devices
* Fixed a bug for Magisk 26.x

# v2.7.1
* Optimized "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" for reducing I/O scheduling jitter
* "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" now confirms and sets the cpu scaling max freq to its available max (sometimes the scaling max freq has been lowered before by a controller on some devices)
* Removed "raw" mixers from template files
* Fixed and adjusted "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" for Tensor devices (e.g., GPU max freq and the mq-deadline scheduler)
* Added supports to Tensor devices; Tensor specific --offload-hifi-playback mode (USB 96kHz or 192kHz fixed for non- hires. music while 48kHz did on stock ROMs) and --bypass-offload-safer mode (only 44kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz and 192kHz are available by using Tensor device's offload driver)
* Note: Audio outputs of stock Tensor devices work by 48kHz & float mode for non-hires. music, 96kHz & 32bit for hires. one, and exceptionally 44.1kHz & 16bit for AAC music files (compressed offload feature) without third party proprietary USB drivers. Till now, the usbv2 HAL driver cannot work at all after AOC (new USB Direct Access feature) was introduced. Tensor's hardware offload driver wouldn't change its sample rate except 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz and 192kHz (float and 32bit int format).

# v2.7.0
* Optimized "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" for reducing I/O scheduling jitter
* Added a support for "sysbta" (System Wide Bluetooth Hal) of recent GSI's and "bluetooth_qti" (experimental)

# v2.6.5
* Optimized "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" for reducing I/O scheduling jitter
* Added extras/dumpsys-bluetooth-filtered.sh command for displaying the active codec information

# v2.6.4
* Optimized "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" for reducing I/O scheduling jitter
* Fixed bugs related to bluetooth SCO Headset (Hands-free) when "--bypass-offload-safer" modes
* Improved "extras/dumpsys-filtered.sh" for bluetooth SCO

# v2.6.3
* Adjusted bluetooth device formats for letting Am*zon music app to output 44kHz & 32bit float format

Note: The Am*zon app determines its output format (of its internal resampler) for bluetooth by looking at the bluetooth device format (picking up the max sample rate if multiple rates specified) in the audio policy configuration XML file on each phone, e.g. outputting 48kHz & 16bit for 48kHz & 16bit phones, 96kHz & 16bit for 96kHz & 16bit phones, 44.1kHz & 32bit float for 44.1kHz & 24bit or 32bit (used by my script). Please choose 44.1kHz & 32bit (or the possible largest bits) in developer settings.

If you like to specify the Am*zon's output format on recent phones, specify "--offload-hifi-playback" and "96k 32", "48k 24", etc. This option changes the initial format of bluetooth devices only, so you can change the current format through developer settings afterward.

# v2.6.2
* Added "--offload-direct" mode for comparing usual (non-a2dp hardware offload) mixer modes to "direct_pcm" and "compressed_offload" modes with&without DRC, especially for bluetooth audio

Note: "direct_pcm" and "compressed_offload" modes cannot avoid default DRC on Qcomm devices. As some recent custom ROM's sometimes reverse on/off of the DRC switch, please confirm the difference by your ears.

# v2.6.1
* Added a bypass offload safer mode for recent MTK devices
* Changed the default behavior to prefer bypass offload safer modes to bypass offload modes for limiting effect only on USB audio

# v2.6.0
* Added support for the usbv2 HAL module
* Tuned for LDAC TWS's (use extras/jitter-reducer.sh --io * medium).

Note: For crDroid Alioth users, try "--bypass-offload-safer 96k 32" or "--offload-hifi-playback 48k 24" option.

# v2.5.5
* Tuned "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" with respect to tunables for "mq-deadline", "kyber" and "none" I/O scheduler (latest kernel common schedulers?)
* Added forgotten wired phone entries in "bypass-offload-safer" mode
* Fixed for the Nyx kernel 4.19 (expiration tunables of its mq-deadline scheduler were changed in 10msec resolution from 3msec)
* Disabled the work queue power efficient mode for reducing jitter if possible (especially for the Nyx kernel and other latest ones)

# v2.5.4
* Fixed a telephone audio configuration issue on Qcomm SoC Android 12 caused by a hal version mismatch
* Added "--bypass-offload-safer" option for keeping the sample rate and the bit depth of internal speakers and a 3.5mm jack to be 48kHz 16/24bit

# v2.5.3
* Tuned "extras/jitter-reducer.sh" for Bluetooth devices, USB DAC's and DLNA receivers
    "extras/jitter-reducer.sh --all --io deadline medium" for Bluetooth devices
    "extras/jitter-reducer.sh --all --io deadline boost" for USB DAC's and DLNA receivers

* Tuned kernel tunables for clearer audio quality

# v2.5.0
* Added extras/change-resampling-quality.sh (to reduce resampling distortion) and extras/change-usb-period.sh (to reduce the jitter of a PLL in a DAC)directly)
* Tuned kernel tunables by assuming an audio scheduling tunable "vendor.audio.adm.buffering.ms" to be "2" (please set this property by my magisk modules ["usb-samplerate-unlocker"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/usb-samplerate-unlocker) and/or ["audio-misc-settings"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/audio-misc-settings))

    2. Tuned kernel tunables for recent Qcomm and MTK devices  

* USB_SampleRate_Changer.sh:  
    1. Added an option specifying "float" bit depth.

# v2.4.10
* Tuned for POCO F3 (SD870) on phh GSI's because I abandoned tuning for custom ROM's on POCO F3 except phh GSI's
* Tuned for SD845 devices; Perhaps also SD855 & SD865 & SD880 devices
* Tuned I/O scheduler and virtual memory parameters, especially on bluetooth earphones

# v2.4.9

Remarks: Don't forget to disable "adaptive battery" in the battery section of "settings" and battery optimizations for "System UI" (system app), etc. to lower reverb like jitter distortion in digital audio outputs.
